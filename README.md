# Thesis-R-Code

This is the R code that I have written for statistical analysis & graphical representations of data for my masters thesis at New England College of Optometry.

Note: if evaluating the intravitreal injection data and ophthalmic drops data, there are some dataframes that have identical names in the code. Take caution to not have the improper data erroneously saved under an identical name.
